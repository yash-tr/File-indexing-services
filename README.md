# File Indexing and Searching Services

This project provides a comprehensive system for indexing and searching files in a directory using various data structures and algorithms. The project supports indexing using Binary Search Tree, B-Tree, and Hashing, and includes functionality for searching files in the indexed data.The file indexing and searching becomes efficient with the use of multithreading.

## Features

### Indexing Methods:
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- B-Tree
- Hashing

### Searching:
- Search files in a directory and subdirectories based on a given string.

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.
- Windows OS (due to the use of Windows.h and other Windows-specific functions).



## Source Files

- `b-tree.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the B-Tree indexing algorithm.
- `binarysearchtree.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the Binary Search Tree (BST) indexing algorithm.
- `hashing.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the Hashing indexing algorithm.
- `search.cpp`: Contains the implementation for searching files in a directory.
- `main.cpp`: The main entry point for the program, handling user interaction and invoking indexing/searching methods.

## How to Build and Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
